# Seattle-Walkable?

Lukas Guericke

Summary:

The focus of this project is to evaluate the geospacial factors that make neighborhoods in Seattle walkable neighborhoods. The goal will be to evaluate whether or not Seattle could be considered a walkable city, which neighborhoods are walkable, and which neighborhoods fail to meet the traditional metrics for a walkable neighborhoods? This project will use geospacial data from the City of Seattle for analysis. 

Background:

Walkable cities and neighborhoods are key pillar of sustainable urban development. Research surrounding walkable cities and neighborhoods has provided evidence that walkable cities and neighborhoods are more livable, better for public health, and better for the enviornment. However, given this, many cities and neighborhoods in the United States are built around the use and ownership of a personal car. Seattle, a rapidly expanding city in terms of population, is not expanding its geographical footprint. 

Problem Statement:

A rigid boundary, difficult geographical features, and an increased population with personal cars has lead to bad traffic and high accident rates. As the population continues to grow, does Seattle invest in sustainable urban development around the carless or in the infrastructre to keep the personal vehicle the primary choice of transportation for Seattlites?
